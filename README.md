# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Visualizer

This is a **web-based visualization tool** for understanding CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to add processes, select different scheduling techniques, and view the execution order using **Gantt Charts**. The tool also calculates performance metrics such as **waiting time, turnaround time, and response time**.

##  Features  
**Supports Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:**  
   - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**  
   - **Shortest Job First (SJF - Non-Preemptive)**  
   - **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**  
   - **Round Robin (RR) with adjustable Time Quantum**  

**User-Friendly Interface:**  
   - Add, edit, and remove processes dynamically  
   - Choose one or multiple algorithms to compare  

**Real-Time Gantt Chart Visualization:**  
   - Displays how processes execute over time  

**Performance Metrics Calculation:**  
   - Average **Waiting Time**, **Turnaround Time**, and **Response Time**  

**Built with:**  
   - **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery
